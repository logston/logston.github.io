<h2>What I wanted</h2>
<p>I really like managing virtual machines with Vagrant. The tool is easy to use
and a real pleasure to play around with. I also really like my Mac. Thus, a
good chunk of my development environments are built using Vagrant on my Mac.
This article shares one wall I ran into while developing with Vagrant on OSX and
how I climbed over that wall.</p>
<p>My Goal:</p>
<p>I would like to serve my app from an environment that is as close to production
(EC2 Linux box) as possible. However, I would like to edit my project's code
with an IDE (PyCharm) installed on my host machine.</p>
<p>My Proposed Setup:</p>
<p>Share a directory on my Mac's local file system that contains all of the code
for my project (ie. my project's repo) with the virtual machine (VM).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-problem">
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>When my Mac shares my project's repo directory with the VM, the VM doesn't
preserve the cases of the letters within the names of the shared files[#]_. For
example,</p>
<blockquote>
/Users/paul/shared_dir/App.py</blockquote>
<p>would be seen as</p>
<blockquote>
/vagrant/app.py</blockquote>
<p>on the VM, assuming that <cite>/vagrant</cite> was mapped to <cite>/Users/paul/shared_dir</cite>.</p>
<p>I first noticed this issue when a series of <cite>ImportError</cite>s (python) began
popping up
while trying to run a management command associated with my Django project.
I had a package named KISSmetrics installed (via pip)
and I also had a file named kissmetrics.py (written by my team)
in the projects repo.</p>
<p>The following line was located in the <cite>kissmetrics.py</cite> file and would cause
the management command to implode when run.</p>
<blockquote>
from KISSmetrics import KM</blockquote>
<p>Now, I could have named <cite>kissmetrics.py</cite> something like
<cite>kissmetrics_utils.py</cite> and solved the problem, but I was more interested in
understanding why two files with different names (one capitalized and one not)
were being interpreted as the same.</p>
<p>This issue especially puzzled me because I thought both
Mac OSX (10.8 at the time) and Ubuntu (12.04) were,
by default, case sensitive.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="investigation">
<h2>Investigation</h2>
<p>After some <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;jasonsuave/a-more-useful-vagrant-38445d0d0736">investigation</a>, I found out that the vagrant VM uses the same drive
formatting rules that the host uses for the shared directory. Thus, if
a directory <cite>/Users/paul/shared_dir</cite> is located on a drive that is formatted as
&quot;Mac OS Extended (Journaled)&quot; (ie. not case-sensitive) on the host machine,
when that directory is shared with the VM as the directory <cite>/vagrant/</cite>
within the VM, the <cite>/vagrant/</cite> directory will also not be case sensitive.
And my host drive was formatted as &quot;Mac OS Extended (Journaled)&quot; rather than
&quot;Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled)&quot;.</p>
<p>So, to jump back to my original issue for a second, when Python tried to import
<cite>KISSmetrics</cite> it raised an <cite>ImportError</cite> because <cite>kissmetrics.py</cite> had already
been imported. Python asked the underlying OS/disk for <cite>KISSmetrics</cite> and the
OS/disk said &quot;OK! Here you go&quot; but handed back <cite>kissmetrics.py</cite> cause the OS/disk
knew no different. The disk didn't understand that it was being asked for a
file with capital letters.</p>
<p>At this point I had a diagnosis. The cure for my issue seemed to be reformatting
my host drive to be &quot;Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled)&quot;.
I wasn't about to do that. Instead, I decided to put my project onto a new
volume which I would format to be case-sensitive.</p>
<p>Below are details on how I created my case-sensitive drive.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="solution">
<h2>Solution</h2>
<div class="section" id="ready-your-mac">
<h3>Ready Your Mac</h3>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Install the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Virtualbox</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html">Vagrant</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="create-a-drive">
<h3>Create a drive</h3>
<p>A case-sensitive drive needs to be created and shared with the vagrant VM.</p>
<p>From within Disk Utility, click &quot;New Image&quot; to create a new drive.</p>
<p>Create a drive with the following configuration:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Size: Custom (8 GB)</li>
<li>Format: Mac OS Extended (Case-Sensitive, Journaled)</li>
<li>Save as: &lt;anything you want&gt;.sparsebundle*</li>
<li>Name: &lt;anything you want&gt;*</li>
<li>Partitions: Single partition - GUID Partition Map</li>
<li>Encryption: None</li>
<li>Image Format: sparse bundle disk image</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The value you give for &quot;Save as&quot; (ie. <cite>&lt;whatever you choose&gt;.sparsebundle</cite>)
will be the name of the sparse bundle on your Mac's local file system.
The value you give for &quot;Name&quot; will be the name of the mounted drive
when you mount the sparse bundle. For example, a mounted drive with a name of
&quot;pauls_drive&quot; will be located at <cite>/Volumes/pauls_drive</cite>.</p>
